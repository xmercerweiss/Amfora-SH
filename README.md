# Amfora Installation Script
[Amfora](https://github.com/makew0rld/amfora) is a popular, user-friendly, and feature-rich TUI client for the [Gemini protocol](https://geminiprotocol.net/). 
This repo contains a simple installation script for x64 Linux systems, intended to make installation as easy as possible for most users. The script simply downloads 
Amfora's binary, makes it executable, downloads a PNG icon, and installs a `.desktop` entry for Amfora. That's it, literally 4 lines.

## Usage
To install Amfora via this script, simply run:
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xmercerweiss/Amfora-SH/refs/heads/main/install.sh | sudo sh
```
